## Movie Website

This is a simple movie website created by **himanshu1221**. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The website allows users to search for movies and displays recommended movies based on their search.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the server on `http://localhost:3000`. You can then open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser to view the website.

### Usage

The website allows users to search for movies and displays recommended movies in the section below the search bar. The frontend sends a request to the backend, which in turn queries the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to retrieve information about movies. The backend then sends the movie information back to the frontend for display.
